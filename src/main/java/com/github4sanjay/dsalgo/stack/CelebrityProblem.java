/*
 * In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone.
 * Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone in the party.
 * We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “. Find the stranger (celebrity) in the minimum number of questions.
 * We can describe the problem input as an array of numbers/characters representing persons in the party.
 * We also have a hypothetical function HaveAcquaintance(A, B) which returns true if A knows B, false otherwise. How can we solve the problem.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input:
 * MATRIX = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
 *            {0, 0, 1, 0},
 *            {0, 0, 0, 0},
 *            {0, 0, 1, 0} }
 * Output:id = 2
 * Explanation: The person with ID 2 does not
 * know anyone but everyone knows him
 *
 * Input:
 * MATRIX = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
 *            {0, 0, 1, 0},
 *            {0, 1, 0, 0},
 *            {0, 0, 1, 0} }
 * Output: No celebrity
 * Explanation: There is no celebrity.

   * This can be solved by elimination technique in O(n) time complexity
   * 1. First put all candidate in stack
   * 2. Pop two elements check if first knows second
   *      a. if yes first cannot be celebrity push second
   *      b. if no then second cannot be celebrity push first
   * 3. when last element left in stack then possibility that this can be celebrity
   * 4. Pop last element and check in row and column if everyone knows it and he does not know everyone.
