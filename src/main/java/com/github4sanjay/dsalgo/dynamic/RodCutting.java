 * Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size
 * smaller than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the
 * pieces.
 *
 * <p>For example, if length of the rod is 8 and the values of different pieces are given as
 * following, then the maximum obtainable value is 22 (by cutting in two pieces of lengths 2 and 6)
 *
 * <p>length | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -------------------------------------------- price | 1 5 8 9 10 17 17
 * 20
 *
 * <p>And if the prices are as following, then the maximum obtainable value is 24 (by cutting in
 * eight pieces of length 1)
 *
 * <p>length | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -------------------------------------------- price | 3 5 8 9 10 17 17
