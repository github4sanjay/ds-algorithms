/**
 * Program for nth Catalan Number Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in
 * many interesting counting problems like following. 1) Count the number of expressions containing
 * n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())),
 * ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()). 2) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys
 * 3) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either
 * two children or no children) with n+1 leaves. 4) Given a number n, return the number of ways you
 * can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.
 *
 * <p>The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430,
 * 4862, …
 *
 * <p>Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution.
 *
 * <p>Recursive Solution Catalan numbers satisfy the following recursive formula.
 *
 * <p>C0=1 and Cn+1= sum{i=0}^{n}Ci*Cn-i for n geq 0;
